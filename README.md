- 👋 Hi, I’m @YvettePWc
- 👀 I’m interested in front end and back end software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript at MIT xPro.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a well-rounded selection of challenging projects that develop my portfolio.
- The shapes.html project exhibits my knowledge in manipulating and layering shapes. It shows that I can control the layering, coloring and centering of circles. This skill is useful in web page design.
- 📫 I can be reached at ywatson2008@yahoo.com.
